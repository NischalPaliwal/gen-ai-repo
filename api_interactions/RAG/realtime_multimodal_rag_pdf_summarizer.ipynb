        "Let's break down the parameters used in the `partition_pdf` function:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `filename`: This is a mandatory parameter that specifies the path to the PDF file you want to process. In this case, it's `/content/data/INM - Week - 6.pdf`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `strategy`: This is also a mandatory parameter that dictates how the PDF content is extracted. Setting it to `\"hi_res\"` (high-resolution) typically means the function will use more advanced techniques, often involving OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and layout analysis, to get a more accurate and detailed extraction of text and elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `extract_images_in_pdf`: When set to `True`, this boolean parameter instructs the function to identify and extract images embedded within the PDF document. These images are often crucial for a complete understanding of the document's content.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `extract_image_block_types`: This parameter specifies the types of image blocks you want to extract. Here, `[\"Image\", \"Table\"]` indicates that the function should look for both standalone images and images that are part of tables. This is particularly useful for documents where tables might be represented as images.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `extract_image_block_to_payload`: If set to `True`, the extracted image blocks (specified by `extract_image_block_types`) would be embedded directly into the element objects returned by `partition_pdf`. However, with `False`, the images are not included in the payload, which can be useful if you only need the text or if the images are very large.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `extract_image_block_output_dir`: This parameter specifies a directory where the extracted image files will be saved. In this example, `\"extracted_data\"` means all extracted images will be stored in a folder named `extracted_data` relative to the current working directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this configuration aims to perform a thorough, high-resolution extraction of both text and image-based content from the specified PDF, saving the extracted images to a local directory.\n",
